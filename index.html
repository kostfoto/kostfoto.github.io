            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am Konstantinos Fotopoulos, a dedicated and passionate student currently in my fifth year at the National Technical University of Athens, pursuing a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My academic journey has been marked by a strong commitment to excellence and a deep interest in various fields of computer science and engineering. I am particularly interested in areas like algorithms, artificial intelligence, and robotics, and I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge research and technology development.</p>
            <p>I began my academic career at the Arsakeio School in Psychiko, where I excelled in my studies, achieving a GPA of 19.8/20. Currently, I am focused on completing my degree at the National Technical University of Athens with a GPA of 9.69/10. Alongside my studies, I have gained valuable experience as a lab assistant and through various research and volunteering opportunities. My involvement in programming competitions and international mathematics and physics contests has further honed my problem-solving and analytical skills.</p>
